Rackspace Cloud Orchestration Getting Started Guide
---------------------------------------------------
Follow the steps described in this guide to use the Rackspace Cloud
Orchestration API to create and access your stacks.

The simple exercises in this guide help you get started with
Orchestration by showing you how to access the API through either
heat client commands or cURL commands.

.. note::
   * If you are interested in learning how to get started with Orchestration
     using the Cloud Control Panel instead of the API, refer to
     :kc-article:`Quick set up with Rackspace Cloud Orchestration
     <quick-set-up-with-rackspace-cloud-orchestration>`.

     Orchestration using one of our SDKs, refer to
