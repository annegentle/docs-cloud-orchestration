**Getting Started Guide**
---------------------------------------------------
Use this *Getting Started Guide* to learn how to authenticate, send API requests, 
and complete basic operations by using the Cloud Orchestration API.

The simple exercises in this guide help you get started with
Orchestration by showing you how to access the API through either
heat client commands or cURL commands.

For more information about Cloud Orchestration concepts and API operations, see the 
:ref:`Developer Guide<developer-guide>` and the :ref:`API Reference<api-reference>`. 

.. note::
  * If you are interested in learning how to get started with Orchestration
    using the Cloud Control Panel instead of the API, refer to
    :kc-article:`Quick set up with Rackspace Cloud Orchestration
    <quick-set-up-with-rackspace-cloud-orchestration>`.

  *  If you are interested in learning how to get started with
     Orchestration using one of our SDKs, refer to
     :rax-devdocs:`Software development kits & tools <#sdks>`.
